Given an array arr, containing price of 'N' cookies, which are to be distributed to 'k' children by splitting the array into 'k' continuous subarrays {containing at least 1 cookies}. You have to divide the array in such a way, that the largest sum of prices among these 'k' subarrays is minimum possible . Return that minimised largest sum.

Input Format --
First line will contain the Number of Tesecases
Second line will contain the size of array , N
Next 'N' lines contains N integers denoting array, arr.
The last line will contain Integer k.

Output Format --
return minimum largest sum if found else return -1.

Constaints
1<=T<=10000
1<=N<=1000
0<=arr[i]<=1000
1<=k<=min(50,N)

Example
Input:
1
5
7 2 5 10 8 2

Output:
18

Output Description
k=2, arr=[7,2,10,8]
Child 1-> 7,2,5 -> 14
Child 2-> 10,8 -> 18
18 is the minimum largest sum that could be of a subarray when given array is splitted into 2 non-empty subarrays
