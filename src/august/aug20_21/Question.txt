Polycarp has a string s. Polycarp performs the following actions until the string s is empty (t is initially an empty string):

he adds to the right to the string t the string s, i.e. he does t=t+s, where t+s is a concatenation of the strings t and s;
he selects an arbitrary letter of s and removes from s all its occurrences (the selected letter must occur in the string s at the moment of performing this action).
Polycarp performs this sequence of actions strictly in this order.

Note that after Polycarp finishes the actions, the string s will be empty and the string t will be equal to some value (that is undefined and depends on the order of removing).

E.g. consider s="abacaba" so the actions may be performed as follows:

t="abacaba", the letter 'b' is selected, then s="aacaa";
t="abacabaaacaa", the letter 'a' is selected, then s="c";
t="abacabaaacaac", the letter 'c' is selected, then s="" (the empty string).
You need to restore the initial value of the string s using only the final value of t and find the order of removing letters from s.
