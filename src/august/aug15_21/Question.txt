In one step , you can take one card from the beginning or from
the end of the row, You have to take exactly k cards .
Your score is the sum of the points of the cards
you have taken .
Given the integer array card points and the integer k and return the maximum score you can obtain


Input Format --
First line will contain the Number of Testcases
Second line will contain the size of array , N
Next 'N' lines contains N integers denoting array, arr.
The last line will contain Integer k.

Output Format --
print the maximum score you can obtain

Constaints
1<=T<=10000
1<=N<=1000
0<=arr[i]<=1000
1<=k<=min(50,N)

Example
Input:
1
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

Output:
7

Output Description
